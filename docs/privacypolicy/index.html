    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p># Capybara Rescue Universe — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
This Privacy Policy explains how the developer/publisher of Capybara Rescue Universe (the “App”) (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “Developer”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the App.

---

## 1) Who is responsible for your data (UK GDPR “Controller”)

**Controller:** Capybara Rescue Universe  
**Contact email:** capybara.rescue.universe@outlook.com  
**Country:** England, UK

If you are in the UK, the Controller is the “data controller” under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.

---

## 2) What data we collect

We may collect the following categories of information:

### A) Information you provide

- **Support communications**: if you email us (or contact support), we collect the information you provide (e.g., email address, message content, and any attachments).
- **Optional in-app inputs**: such as your capybara’s name or other text you enter in the App (if applicable).

### B) Information collected automatically

Depending on how the App is configured and which services are enabled, we and our service providers may collect:

- **Device and app information**: device model, OS version, language, app version, time zone, and identifiers required for app functionality.
- **Usage and diagnostics**: gameplay/events, screen interactions, crashes, performance data, and logs.
- **Approximate location**: inferred from IP address by third-party services (not precise GPS unless you explicitly grant it).

### C) Game data, saves, and sync

- **Local app storage**: we store game state on your device (e.g., progress, earned/purchased virtual items/currency, settings).
- **iCloud Key-Value Store (optional)**: if you have iCloud enabled for the App, Apple may sync certain game state between your devices using iCloud. We do not receive your Apple ID; Apple handles iCloud syncing under your Apple account.

### D) Advertising data (if ads are shown)

If the App displays ads (including rewarded ads):

- **Ad interaction data**: ad impressions, clicks, reward completion, and anti-fraud signals.
- **Device identifiers**: such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) if you opt in via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency prompt, or other identifiers permitted by platform rules.

### E) Purchases

If you make in-app purchases, Apple processes the transaction. We may receive confirmation that a purchase occurred (for example, to unlock “Remove Banner Ads”), but we do not receive your payment card details.

### F) Notifications

If you allow notifications, the App may schedule **local notifications** on your device (for example, reminders related to gameplay). We do not send remote “push notifications” from our own servers.

We do **not** intentionally collect “special category” data (sensitive personal data) such as health data, biometric data, or precise location, unless you explicitly provide it and we clearly explain why.

---

## 3) How we use your data (purposes)

We use information to:

- **Provide and operate the App** (core gameplay, saving progress, features you request)
- **Sync progress across your devices** (if you enable iCloud for the App)
- **Improve the App** (analytics, debugging, crash/performance monitoring)
- **Serve and measure ads** (if enabled), including rewarded ads
- **Provide support** and communicate with you
- **Prevent fraud and abuse** and keep the App secure
- **Comply with legal obligations** and enforce our Terms

---

## 4) Legal bases for processing (UK GDPR / EU GDPR)

If you are in the UK (or EEA), we process personal data under these lawful bases:

- **Contract**: to provide the App features you use and requested services.
- **Legitimate interests**: to improve the App, ensure security, prevent fraud, and understand usage (balanced against your rights).
- **Consent**: when required (e.g., App Tracking Transparency opt-in for IDFA-based tracking; certain ad/analytics settings where applicable).
- **Legal obligation**: to comply with applicable laws and lawful requests.

Where we rely on **consent**, you can withdraw it at any time (see “Your choices and rights”).

---

## 5) Sharing and disclosure

We may share information with:

- **Apple** for App Store purchases (StoreKit) and, if enabled, iCloud syncing (iCloud Key-Value Store).
- **Google** for advertising and consent management (if ads are enabled), including ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention.
- **Legal/Compliance**: if required by law, subpoena, court order, or to protect rights, safety, and security.

We do **not** sell your personal data in exchange for money. Some jurisdictions define “sale”/“sharing” broadly (e.g., for cross-context advertising). See “Region-specific rights” below.

---

## 6) Third-party services

This App uses the following third-party SDKs/frameworks:

- **Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK)**: used to display banner ads and rewarded ads. Provider: Google LLC. See Google’s documentation/policies for how AdMob processes data.
- **Google User Messaging Platform (UMP)**: used to request and manage consent in regions where required (for example, UK/EEA) for ads-related data processing.
- **Apple App Tracking Transparency (ATT)**: used to request permission before accessing IDFA for “tracking” as defined by Apple.
- **Apple StoreKit**: used to process in-app purchases and restore purchases.
- **Apple iCloud Key-Value Store (NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore)**: used to sync certain game state across your devices when iCloud is enabled for the App.
- **SKAdNetwork**: Apple’s privacy-preserving ad attribution framework may be used by ad partners (including via AdMob) for measuring ad campaign performance.

These providers may process data under their own privacy policies:

- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

---

## 7) Advertising and tracking (Apple App Tracking Transparency)

If the App uses IDFA or other data for “tracking” as defined by Apple:

- We will request permission via Apple’s **App Tracking Transparency (ATT)** prompt.
- If you decline, we will not access IDFA for tracking, and ad personalization may be limited.

You can manage tracking permissions in iOS settings at any time.

In this App, the ATT prompt may be shown at relevant times (for example, when you choose to watch a rewarded ad for coins).

---

## 8) Data retention

We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy:

- **Support emails**: typically retained as long as needed to resolve the issue and for reasonable record-keeping.
- **Analytics/diagnostics**: retained according to the configuration of our providers and our needs for improvement and security.
- **iCloud-synced game state**: retained according to your iCloud settings and Apple’s iCloud services; you can disable iCloud for the App in iOS settings.

We may retain information longer where required by law or for legitimate interests (e.g., preventing fraud, enforcing terms).

---

## 9) International transfers

We and our service providers may process information outside the UK/EEA (including in the United States). When transferring personal data internationally, we use appropriate safeguards where required, such as:

- UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) or UK Addendum to EU SCCs
- EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Other lawful transfer mechanisms recognized by applicable law

---

## 10) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 11) Children

The App is not intended for children under **13** (or under the applicable age of digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without appropriate consent where required.

If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

---

## 12) Your choices and rights

### A) UK/EEA rights (UK GDPR / EU GDPR)

If you are in the UK/EEA, you may have the right to:

- **Access** your personal data
- **Rectify** inaccurate data
- **Erase** data (“right to be forgotten”)
- **Restrict** processing
- **Object** to processing (including objection to processing based on legitimate interests)
- **Data portability**
- **Withdraw consent** at any time where processing is based on consent

You can exercise these rights by contacting us at capybara.rescue.universe@outlook.com. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.

### B) Global privacy choices

Regardless of location, you can often:

- Turn off ad personalization / tracking permissions in iOS settings
- Limit analytics where offered within the App (if applicable)
- Contact us to request deletion of support communications

---

## 13) Region-specific disclosures (outside the UK/EEA)

### United States (including California)

Depending on how ads/analytics are configured, some disclosures under laws like the CCPA/CPRA may apply:

- **Categories collected**: identifiers, device/app info, usage, diagnostics, and ad interaction data.
- **Purposes**: operate the App, improve, security, advertising/measurement (if enabled).
- **Rights**: you may have the right to know/access, delete, correct, and opt out of certain “sale”/“sharing” of personal information, and to limit use of sensitive personal information (if applicable).

If you want to exercise these rights, contact us at capybara.rescue.universe@outlook.com. We will respond as required by applicable law and may need to verify your request.

### Other countries

If local law grants you additional rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion, objection), you can contact us and we will work with you consistent with those laws.

---

## 14) Complaints (UK)

If you are in the UK and you have concerns, you can contact us first at capybara.rescue.universe@outlook.com. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

---

## 15) Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice in the App where appropriate.
