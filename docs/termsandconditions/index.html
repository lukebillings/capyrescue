              O App pode oferecer compras no app ("IAP") e assinaturas
              <strong>Pro</strong> opcionais. Todas as compras são processadas
              pela Apple via App Store. Pro oferece benefícios adicionais no
              jogo (moeda virtual extra, itens cosméticos, itens/recursos
              exclusivos Pro e/ou remoção de anúncios em banner). Cobrança é
              recorrente (semanal, mensal ou anual), com renovação automática.
              Alguns planos Pro podem oferecer <strong>período de teste
              gratuito</strong>: ao iniciar um teste gratuito, você não será
              cobrado até o fim do período; ao terminar o teste, a assinatura
              converte-se automaticamente em paga, salvo se você cancelar antes
              do fim do teste. A duração e os termos do teste são exibidos pela
              Apple no momento da adesão. Cancele com pelo menos 24 horas de
              antecedência. O acesso a itens/recursos Pro só está disponível
              enquanto a assinatura Pro estiver ativa. Gerencie ou cancele em
              Configurações de assinatura do Apple ID. Cancelar não dá direito
              a reembolso do período não utilizado, exceto quando a lei
              exigir. Preços e disponibilidade podem mudar. Você concorda em não
              solicitar reembolsos fraudulentos ou chargebacks abusivos. Não
              emitimos reembolsos da App Store diretamente; elegibilidade e
              processamento são da Apple.
