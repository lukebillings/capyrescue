# Capybara Rescue App — Terms & Conditions

**Last updated:** 2026-01-09  
**App name:** Capybara Rescue Universe (also referred to as “Capybara Rescue App”) (the “App”)  
These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the App. By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.

---

## 1) Who we are

“We,” “us,” and “our” refer to the developer/publisher of the App (“Developer”).  
**Developer:** Capybara Rescue Universe  
**Contact:** capybara.rescue.universe@outlook.com

---

## 2) Eligibility

You must be legally capable of accepting these Terms. If you are under the age of majority where you live, you may use the App only with a parent/guardian’s permission and supervision.

---

## 3) License and acceptable use

- **License**: We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms and Apple’s rules.
- **Restrictions**: You may not (and may not attempt to) reverse engineer, decompile, modify, bypass security, cheat, or interfere with the App or its services; use the App to violate any law; or use the App in a way that harms others or the App’s operation.

---

## 4) Gameplay, virtual items, and stat limits (important)

The App may include virtual currency, virtual items, cosmetics, upgrades, and consumables (“Virtual Items”). Virtual Items:

- **Have no real-world value** and are not redeemable for real money or goods/services outside the App.
- **Are licensed, not sold**, and are provided as part of the App experience.

### Stat caps and “overflow” behavior

The App includes capped stats (for example, hunger/thirst/health/comfort) with a maximum value of **100** (or another maximum shown in the App).

- If you use/buy a food or water item and the stat increase would exceed the remaining amount needed to reach **100**, the stat will increase to **100 and not higher**.
- Any “extra” amount beyond the cap is **not carried over** and is **not refundable**.

### Removal or changes to Virtual Items / features (no compensation)

We may, at any time, change, rebalance, limit, discontinue, or remove Virtual Items, features, or content (including items that you obtained via gameplay or purchase).  
**If a Virtual Item you purchased is later changed or removed, you are not entitled to compensation, reimbursement, or replacement**, except where required by applicable law or by Apple’s policies.

---

## 5) In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and refunds

The App may offer in-app purchases (“IAP”) and/or subscriptions. All purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store and are subject to Apple’s terms and billing rules.

- **Pricing and availability**: Prices, offers, and availability may change at any time.
- **No chargebacks/abuse**: You agree not to initiate fraudulent or abusive refund requests or chargebacks.
- **Refunds**: We cannot directly issue App Store refunds. Refund eligibility and processing are handled by Apple, except where required by law. You can request a refund through Apple’s support channels.

If you purchase a subscription, it may automatically renew unless cancelled in your Apple ID subscription settings. Any free trials, renewal dates, and pricing are shown by Apple at purchase time.

---

## 6) Ads, analytics, and third-party services

The App may display advertisements (including banner ads and rewarded ads) and uses third-party services to operate these features.

### Third-party SDKs/services used by this App

- **Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK)**: used to serve banner ads and rewarded ads.
- **Google User Messaging Platform (UMP)**: used to request/manage consent for ads-related data processing in regions where required.
- **Apple App Tracking Transparency (ATT)**: used to request permission before accessing IDFA for “tracking” as defined by Apple.
- **Apple StoreKit**: used to process in-app purchases and restore purchases (e.g., “Remove Banner Ads”).
- **Apple iCloud Key-Value Store**: used to sync certain game state across your devices if iCloud is enabled.
- **SKAdNetwork**: Apple’s privacy-preserving ad attribution framework may be used for ad campaign measurement.

- Third parties may collect information as described in our Privacy Policy (if provided) and in their own policies.
- If the App offers “Remove Ads” or similar features, some elements may still appear (e.g., cross-promo, app notices, or required disclosures), as described in the App.

### Tracking permission

Some ads may use “tracking” as defined by Apple. If so, we will request permission via the iOS **App Tracking Transparency** prompt. If you decline, ad personalization may be limited.

---

## 7) Privacy

Your use of the App is also subject to our Privacy Policy (see `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` in this repository, and/or the version presented in the App/website).

---

## 8) Updates and changes to the App

We may provide updates, patches, or changes to the App (including changes required for security, compatibility, or platform rules). Features may be added, modified, or removed over time.

---

## 9) Account, saves, and data loss

If the App includes local saves and/or cloud saves:

- **No guarantee of persistence**: We do not guarantee that progress, Virtual Items, or saves will always be available.
- **Backups / iCloud**: The App may store game state locally and may sync certain state via iCloud Key-Value Store if enabled on your device. You are responsible for maintaining access to your device and Apple ID. Reinstallations, device changes, corruption, outages, or platform issues may result in loss of progress.

---

## 10) Intellectual property

The App, including code, artwork, 3D models, UI, audio, and trademarks, is owned by the Developer and/or licensors and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not use our assets outside the App without permission.

---

## 11) User content (if applicable)

If the App allows you to submit content (e.g., names, text, feedback):

- You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, and display that content to operate and improve the App.
- You represent you have the rights to submit that content and that it doesn’t violate laws or third-party rights.

---

## 12) Prohibited conduct

You agree not to:

- Exploit bugs, cheat, use automation, or manipulate gameplay systems.
- Harass others, post unlawful content, or attempt unauthorized access to systems.
- Use the App in any way that disrupts servers, ads, analytics, or other users.

We may suspend or terminate access for violations.

---

## 13) Disclaimers

THE APP IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE.”** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  
We do not guarantee the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.

---

## 14) Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP.  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE APP WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO THE DEVELOPER (IF ANY) FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.

---

## 15) Indemnity

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Developer from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any rights of a third party.

---

## 16) Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if you violate these Terms, if required by law, or if the App is discontinued. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability) will survive termination.

---

## 17) Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws of England, excluding conflict-of-law rules, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

---

## 18) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice within the App or on the App listing where required.

---

## 19) Apple-specific terms (required acknowledgement)

If you downloaded the App from the Apple App Store:

- These Terms are between you and the Developer, not Apple.
- Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the App.
- Apple is not responsible for claims relating to the App, including product liability, legal compliance, or consumer protection claims.
- In the event of any third-party claim that the App infringes intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge of such claim.
- You must comply with applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App.
- Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.
